# Nong Hoang Thai (Tyler)

**Senior DevOps Engineer** | Hanoi, Vietnam

## Hey there!

I'm a DevOps Engineer with 8+ years in software development, spending the last 5+ years deep in cloud infrastructure, platform engineering, and CI/CD automation.

My background in backend systems and mobile development gives me a unique perspective on bridging the gap between Dev and Ops. I'm passionate about building reliable infrastructure, exploring emerging technologies, and continuously pushing my limits.

## Certifications

## Beyond Work

Endurance sports enthusiast - completed a half marathon (21km) in under 2 hours and occasionally swims 2km. I believe consistency is a journey, not a destination.
